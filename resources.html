  <summary>Making your own webring...</summary>
  <p>The neat thing about webrings is that they're fairly straightforward to make and manage, assuming you're already comfortable with HTML. It may also be useful to know JavaScript, since many webrings rely on it to function, but don't worry if you don't -- all the resources listed here have extensive instructions to help you navigate the weird technical shiz.
