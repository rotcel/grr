    <h2>wait, what's geek rock?</h2>
    <p>Geek rock -- also called nerd rock or dork rock -- is a subgenre of alternative rock characterized by witty lyrics, punchy melodies, and overall priding in a "nerdy" aesthetic. They Might Be Giants, Lemon Demon, Logan Whitehurst, Little Tin Frog and DEVO are just a few musical acts that come to mind, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geek_rock_artists">but the list is pretty extensive.</a></p>
 <h2>what's a webring?</h2>
    <p>A webring is a collection of websites that are centered around a certain topic -- this topic can be anything, but most are based around some kind of interest or subculture. Websites in a webring are linked together in the shape of a circle, hence the 'ring' part.<br><br>
        
        If you're reading this, you're probably already familiar with what webrings are and how they work -- but just in case you aren't, <a href="history.html">here's a brief history</a> for the pleasure of your eyeholes.<br></p>
     <h2>how do i join?</h2>
    <p>Just add this code to your site and type your site's URL in the box below. This allows me to add it to the member's list.</p> <textarea rows="4" cols="50" id="question" placeholder="Type your site's URL here and click 'send'!"></textarea>
<button id="send">Send</button>
     <h2>are there any requirements to join?</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>You need to have a site, obviously.</li>
    <li>Your site cannot perpetuate bigotry of any kind.</li>
    <p>Other than that, it's pretty much fair game. It helps if you like geek rock, though.</p></ul>
